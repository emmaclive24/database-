<h2>WDD 230 - Web Frontend Development I</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Welcome to WDD 230! This course focuses on contemporary front-end web design and development technologies and the application of those technologies in building web sites. When planning, designing, and developing websites and applications, successful web developers consider the purpose, the target audience, the structure, the organization, the user interface, the site usability, the content, the layout, and the visual (aesthetic) design. This course will teach you to plan, design, and develop websites that conform to web standards while following best practices for positive user experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and other relevant frontend technologies.</p>

The course is a technical, hands-on class, that is more closely tied to industry by requiring deliverables that meet functional and developmental specifications. This course will require between 9&ndash;15 hours of time per week depending upon your experience and understanding of basic computer operations, file management, systems, design, and the core technologies. Even though it requires hard work, you will be successful as long as you plan and use your time and the available resources wisely. Plan on teaching and/or discussing with someone face-to-face, regularly throughout the entire course on the topics you learn directly and indirectly as this regularly activity will help you learn the material at a greater depth.</div>

<div class="callout" style="background-color: #ffffe5; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; font-size: .9rem; margin-bottom: 15px; color: #000;">üèö The intended outcomes of successfully completing this course require that you learn to use the core web technologies of contemporary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The use of third-party templates, frameworks, content management systems, and services to fulfill assignments is <strong>not</strong> <strong>allowed</strong>. These forbidden technologies and systems include but are certainly not limited to WordPress, Wix, and Bootstrap, etc.&nbsp; Any third-party service or interface that is allowed in the course will be explicitly assigned.</div>

<h3>Course Theme</h3>
<p><img style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid #000;" src="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/92902/files/34430628/preview" alt="King Benjamin from the Book of Mormon addresses his people" width="300" height="212" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/92902/files/34430628" data-api-returntype="File" />In Mosiah 4, King Benjamin counsels the people to &ldquo;impart of our substance to others and do all things in wisdom and order.&rdquo; BYU-Idaho follows a structured learning model of preparing, teaching one another, and pondering and proving. As such, the course theme is based upon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosiah 4:15,</a>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosiah 4:27</a>,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.&rdquo;</em> Let us commit to being taught by the Holy Ghost, understanding our own strengths and weaknesses, and go forward with confidence in doing our best.</p>
<h3>Learning Model Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students will participate in regular learning patterns each week.</li>
<li>Students will prepare by completing activities, readings, videos, and labs.</li>
<li>Students will teach one another by participating in peer reviews, developer forums, and students presentations.</li>
<li>Students will ponder by applying and correlating the principles to their discipline and work-based learning opportunities.</li>
<li>Students will prove by completing knowledge assessments, assignments, and programming projects, some with well-defined specifications and other with less definition.</li>
<li>Students will understand the importance of &nbsp;balancing the essential hands-on training activities with professional, academic education, both of which are essential parts of lifelong learning and success in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Required Materials, Software, and Services</h3>
<ul>
<li>Code Editor: Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Cloud Storage and Site Hosting: GitHub with a GitHub Pages repository.</li>

<div class="callout" style="background-color: #dbf3fa; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; font-size: .9rem; margin: 0 15px 15px; color: #000;">Please email your instructor if you have experience in using another text-based editor and wish to use that editor for the class. More than likely you will be permitted to continue to use that editor but you are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to to the VS Code editor with its accompanying extension resources.</div>
<h3>Major Course Activities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developer Forums - an attempt to by analogous to StackOverflow or any other comment board.</li>
<li>Concept Fluency Quizzes - These are given in many lessons to test activity and reading comprehension.</li>
<li>Student Presentations - current and related topic discussion led by a student</li>
<li>Weather Site Project - a continuous enhanced semester long project with developmental specifications</li>
<li>Term Website Project - final evaluation type web site project</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessments and Grading</h3>
<p>Each assessment relates to one or more course objectives and is designed to support a learning outcome. The assessed activities descriptions include grading criteria broken down into specifications that correlate with learning objectives. The student is responsible for understanding the functional and developmental specifications for each assessment. Assessments are tied to course objectives and are assigned to one of the final grade categories, which are weighted. A letter grade will be assigned at the end of the course using a total percentage and standard scale as shown below.</p>
<div class="callout" style="background-color: #ffffe5; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; font-size: .9rem; margin-bottom: 15px; color: #000;">
<p>‚ö†&nbsp; Please note that completing the assignments and activities per the written instructions does not guarantee that you will received full credit on the assessment. By definition, full or 'A' level credit is reserved for those students who "represent outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems." In addition, the hope is that you will work to demonstrate diligent application of the learning model principles, including "initiative in serving other students".<br /><a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system">-BYU-Idaho Grading System</a></p>
